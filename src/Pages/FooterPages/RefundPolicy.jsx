          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            This refund and cancellation policy outlines how you can cancel or seek a refund for a product / service that you have purchased through the Platform. Under this policy:
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Cancellations will only be considered if the request is made within one day of placing the order. However, cancellation requests may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to such sellers / merchant(s) listed on the Platform and they have initiated the process of shipping them, or the product is out for delivery.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Margdarshak Media does not accept cancellation requests for digital services or software as a service. However, the refund / replacement can be made if the user establishes that the quality of the product delivered is not good.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report to our customer service team. The request would be entertained once the seller/ merchant listed on the Platform, has checked and determined the same at its own end. This should be reported within one day of receipt of products. In case you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our customer service within one day of receiving the product. The customer service team after looking into your complaint will take an appropriate decision.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            In case of complaints regarding the products that come with a warranty from the manufacturers, please refer the issue to them.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            In case of any refunds approved by Margdarshak Media, it will take 15 days for the refund to be processed to you.
